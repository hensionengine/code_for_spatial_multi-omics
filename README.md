Tittle: Spatial multi-omics characterization of a type I interferon response dominant subregion in the post-myocardial infarction heart

Abstract
Myocardial infarction (MI) elicits spatiotemporally heterogeneous heart remodeling. However, the underlying genomic and metabolic dynamics within different myocardial regions are still poorly understood, which impedes the development of tissue region-specific clinical therapies. To address this, our work integrated spatial transcriptomics, spatial metabolomics, and single-cell RNA sequencing data, followed by histopathological validation, to ultimately describe the molecular and metabolic landscape of post-MI tissue remodeling. Crucially, we identified an unprecedented border zone subregion, designated the interferon-response border zone (IRBZ). This newly reported subregion is characterized by enriched type I interferon (IFN-I) responses that primarily originate from cardiac vascular endothelial cells. Moreover, it is distinct from the classical extracellular matrix remodeling border zone (ERBZ). Our work also established that lipid metabolic reprogramming is a key downstream process that mediates the pathological effects of the IFN-I response post-MI. These findings redefine the pathophysiology of MI tissue remodeling and provide novel insights for the development of tissue region-specific MI therapies.
